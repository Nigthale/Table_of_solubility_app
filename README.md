It is a little Chemistry-related app, written on Py, I made as a school project to gain an A as a final mark on the subject of Chemistry
that shows state, color and formula of the compound made of an Anion and Cation which you choose in the Gui written in PYQT.
Sadly, the app is available only in Russian because my teacher couldn't speak and read English and asked me to write it fully in Russian.
be cautious, haha, it is incredibly inoptimized and poorly-written
